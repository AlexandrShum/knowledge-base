# üìö Data Structures in JavaScript  

This document provides an overview of fundamental data structures used in JavaScript, along with their descriptions, use cases, advantages, and disadvantages.  

## üèóÔ∏è 1. Arrays  
### Description  
An `Array` is a data structure that stores elements sequentially in memory and allows access via indexes. JavaScript arrays are dynamic, meaning they can grow or shrink in size and store elements of different types.

In JavaScript, an `Array` is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element, and each element has a numeric position in the array, known as its index. Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

### Use Cases  
- Storing lists of data (e.g., a list of users, products, or messages)  
- Implementing other data structures (e.g., stacks, queues)  
- Iterating over collections using loops and array methods  

### Advantages  
‚úîÔ∏è Fast random access using indexes (O(1))  
‚úîÔ∏è Built-in high-level methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.)  
‚úîÔ∏è Can store different data types  

### Disadvantages  
‚ùå Costly insertions and deletions in the middle (O(n))  
‚ùå Requires contiguous memory allocation

### üî¢ Array Operations and Time Complexity  
| Operation           | Example             | Time Complexity |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Access by index    | `arr[i]`            | **O(1)**       |
| Insert at the end  | `arr.push(value)`   | **O(1) / O(n)** |
| Remove from end    | `arr.pop()`         | **O(1)**       |
| Insert at start    | `arr.unshift(value)` | **O(n)**       |
| Remove from start  | `arr.shift()`       | **O(n)**       |
| Insert in middle   | `arr.splice(i, 0, value)` | **O(n)** |
| Remove from middle | `arr.splice(i, 1)`  | **O(n)**       |
| Copy array         | `arr.slice()`       | **O(n)**       |

## üîó 2. Linked List  
### Description  
A `Linked List` is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It is a sequential data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike [arrays](#Ô∏è-1-arrays), linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, making insertions and deletions more efficient. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stack, queue and deque. 

### Here‚Äôs the comparison of Linked List vs Arrays
| Feature            | Linked List          | Array               |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Data Structure** | Non-contiguous       | Contiguous           |
| **Memory Allocation** | Allocated per element | Allocated for whole array |
| **Insertion/Deletion** | Efficient (O(1) at head) | Inefficient (O(n) due to shifting) |
| **Access** | Sequential (O(n)) | Random (O(1)) |

## Types of Linked Lists
| Type            | Description| 
|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Singly Linked List** | Each node has a pointer to the next node only. |
| **Doubly Linked List** | Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes. |
| **Circular Linked List** | The last node links back to the first, forming a loop. |

### Singly Linked List
In a `singly linked list`, each node consists of two parts: data and a pointer to the next node. This structure allows nodes to be dynamically linked together, forming a chain-like sequence.

### Doubly Linked List
A `doubly linked list` is a more complex data structure than a singly linked list, but it offers several advantages. The main advantage of a doubly linked list is that it allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions. This is because each node in the list contains a `pointer to the previous node` and a `pointer to the next node`. This allows for quick and easy insertion and deletion of nodes from the list, as well as efficient traversal of the list in both directions.

### Circular Linked List
A `circular linked list` is a special type of linked list where all the nodes are connected to form a circle. Unlike a regular linked list, which ends with a node pointing to NULL, the last node in a circular linked list points back to the first node. This means that you can keep traversing the list without ever reaching a NULL value.

### Use Cases  
- Efficient insertions and deletions in dynamic applications  
- Implementing stacks and queues  
- Memory-efficient data management when frequent resizing is needed  

### Advantages  
‚úîÔ∏è Efficient insertions and deletions (O(1) at the head)  
‚úîÔ∏è No need for contiguous memory allocation  

### Disadvantages  
‚ùå Slower access time compared to arrays (O(n) for lookup)  
‚ùå Extra memory overhead due to pointers

## üì¶ 3. Stack  
### Description  
A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the `Last In, First Out (LIFO)` principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in various applications, such as function call management, undo mechanisms, and parsing expressions.

### LIFO(Last In First Out) Principle
Here are some real world examples of LIFO
 * Consider a stack of plates. When we add a plate, we add at the top. When we remove, we remove from the top.
 * A shuttlecock box (or any other box that is closed from one end) is another great real-world example of the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle where do insertions and removals from the same end.

### Operations Performed on a Stack
- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
- Peek (or Top): Returns the top element without removing it.
- isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
- Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

### Use Cases  
- Undo/redo functionality in applications  
- Function call stack in programming languages  
- Expression evaluation (e.g., parentheses matching)  

### Extreme Conditions in a Stack
- Stack Underflow:  
  Occurs when you try to perform a pop or peek operation on an empty stack.
  Handling: Check if the stack is empty before performing these operations.
-  Stack Overflow:
  Occurs when you try to push an element into a stack that has reached its maximum capacity (in languages or implementations where the stack size is fixed).
  Handling: Check if the stack is full before performing a push operation.


### Advantages  
All operations in the Stack Class ( Push , Pop, Peek, isEmpty, Size,) have O(1) time complexity.  print Stack(), which is O(n).

### Disadvantages  
‚ùå Limited access (only the top element can be accessed)  
‚ùå Can lead to stack overflow in recursive applications

## üö¶ 4. Queue  
### Description  
A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data in a specific order. It follows the principle of `First in, First out (FIFO)`, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues are commonly used in various algorithms and applications for their simplicity and efficiency in managing data flow.

### FIFO Principle in Queue
FIFO Principle states that the first element added to the Queue will be the first one to be removed or processed. So, Queue is like a line of people waiting to purchase tickets, where the first person in line is the first person served. (i.e. First Come First Serve).

### Operations on Queue
 - Enqueue: Enqueue operation adds (or stores) an element to the end of the queue.
 - Dequeue: Dequeue operation removes the element at the front of the queue.
 - Peek/Front: This operation returns the element at the front end without removing it.
 - Size: This operation returns the numbers of elements present in the queue.
 - isEmpty: This operation returns a boolean value that indicates whether the queue is empty or not.
 - isFull: This operation returns a boolean value that indicates whether the queue is full or not.

### Use Cases  
- Task scheduling (e.g., print queue, request processing)  
- Managing asynchronous operations (e.g., event loops, job queues)  
- Implementing breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs  

### Advantages  
‚úîÔ∏è Maintains order of processing requests  
‚úîÔ∏è Efficient O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations in a linked list implementation  

### Disadvantages  
‚ùå Slower element access (O(n) lookup)  
‚ùå Array-based implementations require shifting elements for dequeue (O(n))  

### Examples

## üîë 5. Hash Table (Object/Map)  
### Description  
A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs for fast lookups. In JavaScript, objects and `Map` structures serve as hash tables.  

### Use Cases  
- Implementing dictionaries and caches  
- Storing and retrieving data efficiently  
- Managing sets of unique keys  

### Advantages  
‚úîÔ∏è Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions (O(1) on average)  
‚úîÔ∏è No need to iterate over elements for searching  

### Disadvantages  
‚ùå Possible hash collisions, which degrade performance  
‚ùå Consumes extra memory for storing hash keys

## üå≥ 6. Binary Tree  
### Description  
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right). A binary search tree (BST) maintains a sorted order of elements.  

### Use Cases  
- Efficient searching and sorting  
- Implementing hierarchical structures (e.g., DOM tree)  
- Decision-making processes (e.g., game AI, expression trees)  

### Advantages  
‚úîÔ∏è Faster search compared to linked lists (O(log n) in balanced trees)  
‚úîÔ∏è Good for hierarchical data representation  

### Disadvantages  
‚ùå Unbalanced trees can degrade performance to O(n)  
‚ùå Requires additional memory for pointers

## üîó 7. Graph  
### Description  
A graph is a data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. It can be directed or undirected.  

### Use Cases  
- Representing networks (social networks, web links, transport routes)  
- Pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra‚Äôs, A*)  
- Dependency resolution (e.g., task scheduling, package management)  

### Advantages  
‚úîÔ∏è Powerful representation for complex relationships  
‚úîÔ∏è Supports a variety of traversal techniques (DFS, BFS)  

### Disadvantages  
‚ùå More complex implementation compared to other structures  
‚ùå Requires additional memory for adjacency lists or matrices
